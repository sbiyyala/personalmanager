# Test App :: Personal Manager --
# Technologies: Google App Engine, Python, webapp2 


Features:

1. This is a small app for maintain your personal notes. The notes can be anything; from a normal todo list to bookmarks.

2. The working of the app is simple, it validates using your google account and pulls your bookmarks, notes and other info.

3. The idea is conceptualized from my personal experience of storing programming state at the end of a day at job/school and having a global 'todo' list. Any software development (from my experience) is characterized by a lot references from the internet, (especially learning a new technology). Having a small app like 'Personal  Manager' helps you stay synchronized, devoid of dependence on one machine.

4. An extra feature is that each time you store a web link, it gets automatically referenced (linkified'), just like what happens when a link is emailed.  

** I have been a Django person in my current job, hence the organization of the python files resembles django-like structure. That's pretty much the only similarity with django. This way, there isn't any clutter which occurs with dumping everything into one python file.
